cNW: Circular Needleman-Wunsch
===

For finding the best alignment of a pair of circular sequences (DNA, RNA or
Protein). This is a naive way of solving the pairwise circular sequence
alignment problem. It tests every rotation of sequence *x* against *y* and prints
out the position of the best rotation of *x* and the similarity score.
